# JavaScript/TypeScript Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through the setup process for the Mirror World Smart
SDK on JavaScript/TypeScript.

## 1. Create a Developer Account

Create a developer account on the
[Developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun). Create project and create an
API Key. If you already have an API Key, you may skip this step and proceed to
the next one.

## 2. Install the JS Mirror World SDK

The Mirror World SDK for JavaScript implements a TypeScript-compatible client
that can be used for both in the browser and Node.js. Install it with the
package manager of your choice:

```sh install.sh
# With Yarn
yarn add @usemirrorworld/web3.js

# With npm
npm install @usemirrorworld/web3.js

# With pnpm
pnpm install @usemirrorworld/web3.js
```

---

## 3. Import the SDK

You can now import the Mirror World SDK into your project.

```ts main.ts focus=1
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@usemirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY",
  env: ClusterEnvironment.testnet, // Can be ClusterEnvionment.mainnet for mainnet
})

async function main() {
  await mirrorworld.login()
  await mirrorworld.getTokens()
  await mirrorworld.getNFTs()
}

main()
```

---

## 4. Initialize SDK with API Key

With your API Key, you can now initialize the SDK in your project.

```ts main.ts focus=3:6
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@usemirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY",
  env: ClusterEnvironment.testnet, // Can be ClusterEnvionment.mainnet for mainnet
})

async function main() {
  await mirrorworld.login()
  await mirrorworld.getTokens()
  await mirrorworld.getNFTs()
}

main()
```

---

## 5. Start building!

You can start invoking the various methods on the `MirrorWorld` instance. Enjoy!

```ts main.ts focus=8:14
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@usemirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY",
  env: ClusterEnvironment.testnet, // Can be ClusterEnvionment.mainnet for mainnet
})

async function main() {
  await mirrorworld.login()
  await mirrorworld.getTokens()
  await mirrorworld.getNFTs()
}

main()
```

## Going Further

Great! At this point you're pretty much ready to start doing building with the
JavaScript SDK for Mirror World. There are a few things you can do to proceed
from here:
