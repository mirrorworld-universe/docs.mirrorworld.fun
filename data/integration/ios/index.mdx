# iOS (Swift) Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through the setup process for the Mirror World Smart SDK on iOS (Swift).

## Step 1: Create a Developer Account
Create a developer account on the [Developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun). Create project and create an API Key. If you already have an API Key, you may skip this step and proceed to the next one.

## Step 2 - Add the Mirror World SDK dependency CocoaPods

`MirrorWorldSDK` is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
pod 'MirrorWorldSDK'
end

```
## Step 3 - Install `MirrorWorldSDK` using CocoaPods
Run the following command to install the SDK on your project:

```sh
pod install
```

## Step 4 - Configuring `URLScheme` in `info.plist`
The Mirror World iOS SDK uses a custom SDK to pass information into the SDK client. In order to enable this
functionality, you need to configure `UrlScheme(mwsdk)` in your project.

Set `UrlScheme` in the `info.plist` file of your project: `mwsdk` like this:

![`info.plist`](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/mirrorworld-sdk-ios/blob/master/Example/MirrorWorldSDK/infoplist-UrlScheme-desc.png?raw=true)

  ## Step 5 - Usage

  Import and initialize the Mirror World SDK in the `AppDelegate`.

  ```swift AppDelegate.swift
  import MirrorWorldSDK

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

      MWSDK.initSDK(env: .StagingDevNet, apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY")
      // ---------
      return true
  }

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, handleOpen url: URL) -> Bool {

      MirrorWorldSDK.share.handleOpen(url: url)
      return true
  }

  ```
