In this guide, you will create an NFT marketplace for listing and trading NFT
for the NFTs you created using the Mirror World SDK. If you do not yet have a
collection, please follow
[this guide to create an ERC721/ERC1155 collection](/guides/how-to-create-evm-nft-collection),
mint some NFTs and return to this page to create an NFT Marketplace to your
collection.

That's it! Let's move forward to the pre-requisites. Make sure that your
`collection_address` is prepared, you have your API credentials (API Key and
Secret Access Key) ready, and your wallet has been funded. If you haven't funded
your project wallet yet, follow the instructions in the "Funding your project
wallet" section. If you don't have your API credentials yet, refer to the "API
Credentials" section for instructions on how to acquire them.

## Pre-requisites

- [ ] Your `collection_address` is prepared. You may also prepare multiple
      collections
- [ ] Your have prepared your API credentials (API Key and Secret Access Key).
- [ ] Your project wallet has been funded.

### Funding your project wallet

> Skip this section if your project wallet is already funded

Before deploying your Marketplace Instance, you need to make sure that your
project wallet is funded with enough funds to pay the gas fee for deployment.

You can see your project wallet on the top-right of the developer dashboard when
you select the Chain/Network combination on the developer dashboard.

- **For Mainnet**, you can fund your wallet by directly transferring funds into
  your project wallet from an external wallet, or exchange.
- **For Testnet,** you can use a faucet to get tokens. Examples of popular
  testnet faucets include [https://mumbaifaucet.com/](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)
  and [https://goerlifaucet.com/](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

### API Credentials

> Skip this section if you already have your API credentials

Minting NFTs requires the following API credentials:

- **API Key** - passed in to the `x-api-key` header. If you don't have an API
  Key, please use the
  [Getting Started](/overview/development-guide/projects#creating-a-project)
  guide to create a project and get the API Key for your project.
- **Secret Access Key** - passed into the
  `Authorization: Bearer <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>` header. If you don't have your
  Secret Access Key yet, please follow
  [this guide to acquire your Secret Access Key](/overview/development-guide/developer-dashboard#secret-access-key-management).

## Deploying your Marketplace Instance

Behind the scenes, Mirror World uses the widely supported
[Seaport Protocol](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport) to orchestrate
marketplace listings and transactions.

Seaport is a marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling
NFTs. Each listing contains an arbitrary number of items that the offerer is
willing to give (the "offer") along with an arbitrary number of items that must
be received along with their respective receivers (the "consideration").

### With HTTP

You can use the
[Deploy Marketplace Instance API](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#072c6557-5b9d-4140-b2fe-4e8e4c72ad34)
to deploy your NFT Marketplace instance.

Replace `:chain` and `:network` parameters to the chain and network combination
you want to deploy to.

> Here is the full
> [table of supported chains](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#multichain-support-matrix).

_Required parameters:_

- **`seller_fee_basis_points`**: The seller fee basis points

_Optional parameters:_

- **`payment_token`**: The payment token address. Default is null, which means
  the native token
- **`storefront`**: The storefront UI configuration details. Used when deploying
  a storefront client application The `storefront` configuration conforms to the
  following schema:
  ```tsx
  export interface IStorefrontConfig {
    subdomain: string
    name: string
    description: string
    logo?: string
    banner?: string
  }
  ```
- **`collections`**: The array of ERC721/ERC1155 collections to be added to the
  marketplace.

In this example for the `payment_token`, we shall use polygon's MATIC testnet
token address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010`)

Below is an example code snippet. Take note of the variables to be replaced

```tsx
curl --location 'https://api.mirrorworld.fun/v2/:chain/:network/asset/marketplaces/create' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
				"payment_token": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010",
        "seller_fee_basis_points": 100,
        "collections": ["SOME_COLLECTION_ADDRESS"]
    }'
```

### With JavaScript SDK

This example uses the JavaScript SDK to create an NFT marketplace on Polygon
Testnet.

```tsx
import { MirrorWorld, Polygon, EVMContractType } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  chainConfig: Polygon("mumbai-testnet"),
  auth: {
    secretAccessKey: "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
  },
})

const payload = {
  payment_token: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010",
  seller_fee_basis_points: 100,
}

const marketplace = await mirrorworld.Polygon.Asset.createMarketplace(payload)
console.log("my new marketplace", marketplace)
```

Successfully creating a marketplace returns an object with the
`marketplace_address` property. This represents your marketplace instance. Keep
this address as you will use it to transact with your marketplace.

You have successfully an EVM-compatible Marketplace.

## Listing, Buying and Transacting with your NFT Marketplace

You can list your NFTs using the
[List NFT API](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#7e46147f-3ece-4e45-afe8-0633db127bf3).

### With HTTP API

_Required parameters:_

- **`collection_address`**: The address of the collection
- **`token_id`**: The `token_id` of the NFT
- **`price`**: The price of the NFT
- **`marketplace_address`**: The address of the marketplace

_Optional parameters:_

- **`confirmation`**: The confirmation level of the transaction. Default is
  finalized. Allowed values are finalized and confirmed

Replace `:chain` and `:network` parameters to the chain and network combination
you want to deploy to.

> Here is the full
> [table of supported chains](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#multichain-support-matrix).

```tsx
curl --location 'https://api.mirrorworld.fun/v2/:chain/:network/asset/auction/list' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "collection_address": "<YOUR_COLLECTION_ADDRESS>",
        "token_id": 1,
        "price": 0.1,
        "marketplace_address": "<YOUR_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS>"
    }'
```

### With JavaScript SDK

This example uses the JavaScript SDK to list an NFT on your marketplace

```tsx
import { MirrorWorld, Polygon, EVMContractType } from '@mirrorworld/web3.js';

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  chainConfig: Polygon("mumbai-testnet"),
  auth: {
    secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
  },
})

const payload = const payload = {
  collection_address: 'YOUR_COLLECTION_ADDRESS',
  price: 0.1,
  token_id: 1,
  marketplace_address: 'YOUR_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS',
}

const listing = await mirrorworld.Polygon.Asset..listNFT(payload);
console.log("token listing", listing)
```
