In this article, you’re going to learn how to integrate a service that enables
your users to buy cryptocurrencies using the method they are already used to
such as credit and debit cards. Token On-Ramp is the process of buying crypto
with fiat currency using a credit, debit card or even by making a transfer. This
is a game changer in web3 right now because it reduces the friction of
onboarding web3 native into web3.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, you want to make sure that you already have a Mirror
World developer account and an already created project. If you're yet to create
one, head over to https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login to get started or go
through this guide for a proper explanation.

## Create UI Widget URL

Base URL:

```bash
http://onramp.mirrorworld.fun/
```

Now let’s get straight into building! The only thing you need to do is to add
the base URL to your iframe or webview on mobile, the on-ramp provider will
guide you on how to complete your purchase.

| URL Param         | Required? | Sample            |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| `api_key`         | `Yes`     | `<mw_live_abcxx>` |
| `fiat_currency`   | `No`      | `<USD>`           |
| `fiat_amount`     | `No`      | `<200>`           |
| `crypto_currency` | `No`      | `<ETH>`           |
| `network`         | `No`      | `<Ethereum>`      |
| `wallet_address`  | `No`      | `<0x000000>`      |

You can also modify the URL with custom data using any of the above parameters,
for example, Let's say I want the initial fiat amount on the widget to be 500
then you can modify the URL to like this:

```bash
http://onramp.mirrorworld.fun/?fiat_amount=500
```

You can find the full list of parameters in this notion doc:

## How to test the integration

To test the integration, you can use our staging environment
https://onramp-staging.mirrorworld.fun and get test cards from our current
providers below and then run some test transactions.
