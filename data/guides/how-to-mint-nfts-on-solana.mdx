Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a new form of asset that can represent anything
from digital art to game items and are stored on the blockchain's distibuted
ledger. NFTs are unique, immutable and transparent.

People collect NFTs for various reasons, one of which may include having access
to certain communities or having access to games. For example, on Mirror World,
you may collect an NFT play as a character in a game.

In this guide, we'll look at how to mint NFTs on Solana using the Mirror World
Smart SDK

## Getting Started

Before getting started, you want to make sure that you already have a Mirror
World developer account and an already created project. If you're yet to create
one, head over to https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login to get started or go
through this guide for a proper explanation.

### Create A Collection

Collections are like a folder for your NFTs. This is where your NFTs are going
to be stored for distribution later. To create a collection, sign in to your
developer dashboard and click on the "NFT Collections" tab displayed on the
sidebar underneath the "Project Info" button.

Click on the Create Collection button to create a new collection. You'll be
redirected to a page asking you for more information about your collection.
Please make sure to fill in every field with the appropriate information.

After creating a collection, you should be redirected to the collections page
and see your collection added to the collections list for your project.

## Guide To Minting An NFT.

The process of minting an NFT could be quite tedious, but with the mirrorworld
SDK, this process has been simplified to writing just a few lines of code. Let's
go ahead and build this out using Javascript (React frontend).

### Project Setup

Create a simple React app using Vite by running this command in your terminal
and selecting "React" from the prompt:

```shell
yarn create vite mint-nft
```

### Install the Mirror World Smart SDK

Next, let's make sure we have the Mirror World Smart SDK installed in our
project. This will enable us to implement the NFT minting feature the SDK
provides. Run the following command in your project's root directory in the
terminal:

```shell
yarn add @mirrorworld/web3.js
```

### Mint NFT

Let's implement the mintNFT method into our app. In your App.jsx delete the
starter code and add the following code to set up Mirror World and
authentication in our app. We add some extra code to fetch and use refreshToken
which will help us validate requests.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { MirrorWorld, Solana } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"

import "./App.css"

function App() {
  const [refresh, setRefreshTok] = useState(
    localStorage.getItem(`app-refresh-token`),
  )

  const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
    apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY", //Replace this with your own API Key
    chainConfig: Solana("devnet"),
    autoLoginCredentials: refresh ?? undefined, // we need this to validate our requests
  })
  const [user, setUser] = useState()

  async function login() {
    const { user, refreshToken } = await mirrorworld.login()
    localStorage.setItem(`app-refresh-token`, refreshToken)
    setRefreshTok(refreshToken)
    setUser(user)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    if (refresh) {
      console.log(refresh)
      setMirrorWorld(
        new MirrorWorld({
          apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY",
          chainConfig: Solana("devnet"),
          autoLoginCredentials: refresh,
        }),
      )
    }
  }, [refresh])

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {!user ? <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button> : ""}
      {user ? (
        <div className="user-info">
          <p>{user.username} is logged in</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>No User available</p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

Now that we have set up authentication, let's create and function to mint our
NFT and add a button that invokes that function:

```jsx
...
async function mintMyNft() {
    await mirrorworld.Solana.Asset.mintNFT({
      name: `YOUR_NFT_NAME`,
      symbol: `NFT_SYMBOL`,
      metadataUri: "YOUR_NFT_METADATAURI",
      collection: "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID",
    });
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      {!user ? (
        <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <button onClick={mintMyNft}>Mint NFT</button>
        </div>
      )}
      {user ? (
        <div className="user-info">
          <p>{user.username} successfully logged in</p>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <p>No User available</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `mintNFT` method takes in four parameters.

1. name: The name of the NFT.
2. symbol: The unique symbol of the NFT e.g
3. metadataUri: This is where the metadata for the NFT is stored
4. collection: The value of collection is the ID of the collection we created
   earlier on a dashboard.

We should now be able to successfully mint our NFT into our collection at the
click of a button.

To confirm that this transaction was successful, head over to
explorer.solana.com, enter the signature or mint address returned from the
transaction and you should find your newly minted NFT there!
