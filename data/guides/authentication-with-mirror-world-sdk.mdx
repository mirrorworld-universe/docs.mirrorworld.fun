In this tutorial, we shall be covering how to authenticate your users with the
Mirror World SDK. This specific tutorial will be focusing on JavaScript for the
front end.

> We shall be creating more tutorials for back end authentication soon! If you
> are looking for other frameworks, please see the
> [integration guides for **Android, Unity, iOS and Rust**](/integration).

## Getting Started

### Create a Mirror World Project

The first step to building with the Mirror World SDK is to create a project and
get it's **API Key**. Please follow the guide on
[creating your first Mirror World Project](/overview/getting-started).

If you have an API Key, you can skip the step.

### Install dependencies

<CodeSnippet id="tutorial/installation.mdx" />

> See [Android Installation Guide](/integration/android) and
> [Unity Installation Guide](/integration/unity) for Android and Unity
> respectively

### Project Setup

Create a Next JS app by running this command in your terminal

```shell
yarn create next-app mirrorworld-js
# or
npx create-next-app@latest mirrorworld-js
```

### Install the Mirror World Smart SDK

Next, let's make sure we have the Mirror World Smart SDK installed in our
project. This will enable us to run the following command in your project's root
directory, in the terminal:

```shell
yarn add @mirrorworld/web3.js
```

### Implementing Login

Let's implement login functionality into our app using the Mirror World Smart
SDK. To use the SDK, we'll need to create a new instance of the SDK.

Edit your **index.tsx** file to look like this

📁 **pages/index.tsx**

```tsx
import { MirrorWorld, Solana } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

export default function Home() {
  const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
    apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY", // Replace this with the API Key for your project
    chainConfig: Solana("mainnet-beta"),
  })

  return <div className={styles.container}></div>
}
```

Next, we're going to create a function that logs the user in, and a button to
trigger that function.

Update your **index.tsx** file to look like this

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { MirrorWorld, Solana } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

export default function Home() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState()

  const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
    apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY", // Replace this with the API Key for your project
    chainConfig: Solana("mainnet-beta"),
  })

  async function login() {
    const { user } = await mirrorworld.login()
    setUser(user)
  }

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

As you can see, we've bound the login method to the button. When you click on
the button a popup appears giving you multiple options to login to mirror world.

We also include a user state using the `useState` hook from React so that we can
set the user object and use it in our app as we'll see shortly.

Let's go ahead and display the user information in our app with this piece of
code:

```tsx
return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
        {user ? (
          <div className="user-info">
              <ul>
                <li>Username: {user.username} </li>
                <li>Email: {user.email}</li>
                <li>ETH Address: {user.wallet.eth_address}</li>
                <li>SOL Address: {user.wallet.sol_address}</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p>No User available</p>
        )}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Try to log in again and you should see your user details displayed like this:

## Extract Login Logic to a React Hook for

Great! With the current setup, the user can now login at the click of a button,
however, we would like to refresh the user's login state everytime the visit the
app so that they don't have to keep logging in every time they come to your app.

### Create `useMirrorWorld` hook

Let's create a new hook called `useMirrorWorld` that will provide our SDK
instance and automatically fetch user's state each time the app loads.

Create a new file called `useMirrorWorld.tsx` with the following code.

<CodeSnippet id="tutorial/use-mirrorworld.mdx" />

Great! now you have a created a helper hook to clean up your `index.tsx` page.

### Wrap `app.tsx` with the `MirrorWorldProvider` component

Wrap your `_app.tsx` with the `MirrorWorldProvider` component we just created in
our `useMirrorWorld.tsx` file 👇🏽

```tsx
// In your pages/_app.tsx file

import type { AppProps } from "next/app"
import { MirrorWorldProvider } from "../path/to/useMirrorWorld.tsx"

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <MirrorWorldProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MirrorWorldProvider>
  )
}
```

### Refactor `pages/index.tsx` to use the `useMirrorWorld` hook.

Phew! We can now clean up our `pages/index.tsx` page as shown below.

```tsx
// Your new `pages/index.tsx` file

import { useState } from "react"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"
import { useMirrorWorld } from "../path/to/useMirrorWorld.tsx" // [tl! ++]

export default function Home() {
  // Simplified home page code!
  const { user, login } = useMirrorWorld()

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
        {user ? (
          <div className="user-info">
            <ul>
              <li>Username: {user.username} </li>
              <li>Email: {user.email}</li>
              <li>ETH Address: {user.wallet.eth_address}</li>
              <li>SOL Address: {user.wallet.sol_address}</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p>No User available</p>
        )}
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Congrats! Now your user's will automatically be logged in whenever they visit
your app!
