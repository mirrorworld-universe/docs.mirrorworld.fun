Fiat on-ramp service allows users to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency. In MirrorWorld, we partner with multiple third-party on-ramp providers to provides a seamless experience to use all major payment methods, including debit and credit card, local bank transfers and other local payment methods.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, you want to make sure that you already have a Mirror
World developer account and an already created project. If you're yet to create
one, head over to https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login to get started or go
through this guide for a proper explanation.


### Create UI Widget URL

Base URL:

```bash
http://onramp.mirrorworld.fun/
````

| URL Param  | Required?        | Sample           |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `api_key`  | `Yes`            | `<mw_live_abcxx>`|

Once you get the URL, you can open it in your app (e.g. webview, iframe). The on-ramp provider will guide the user to finish the purchase process, including typing in payment information and KYC if needed.
