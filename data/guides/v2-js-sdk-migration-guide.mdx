In this guide, we'll go over the changes you need to make to upgrade to v2 of
the JS SDK.

## Breaking Changes

- The `env` constructor property has been removed the constructor options in
  favour of the `chainConfig` property.
- The `clusterEnv`, `tokens`, `nfts` and `transaction` accessors have been
  removed from the `MirrorWorld` class instance. You can now asynchronously
  fetch these resources directly from the corresponding chain methods.

## Upgrade Steps

To install the latest version of the JS SDK, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm add @mirrorworld/web3.js
# or with Yarn
yarn add @mirrorworld/web3.js
# or with NPM
npm install @mirrorworld/web3.js
```

### Defining a chain configuration

The Mirror World JS SDK exports configuration factories for following multiple
chains:

- `Solana` - [Solana](solana.com/) chain configuration
- `Ethereum` - [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) chain configuration
- `BNBChain` - [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en) configuration
- `Polygon` - [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) chain configuration

Below is an example of how to initialize the SDK with a Solana Configuration for
the mainnet-beta network.

```ts
import { MirrorWorld, Solana } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  chainConfig: Solana("mainnet-beta"),
})
```

After assigning this configuration, you can now invoke `Solana` methods with the
SDK.

The table below shows the network names configuration parameters accepted by the
corresponding chain.

| Chain      | Mainnet name     | Testnet name     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `Solana`   | `mainnet-beta`   | `devnet`         |
| `Polygon`  | `mumbai-mainnet` | `mumbai-testnet` |
| `BNBChain` | `bnb-mainnet`    | `bnb-testnet`    |
| `Ethereum` | `mainnet`        | `goerli`         |

For example, below is an example of how to initialize the SDK on Polygon Testnet
and mint an NFT

```ts
import { MirrorWorld, Solana } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  chainConfig: Polygon("mumbai-testnet"),
})

await mirrorworld.Polygon.Asset.mintNFT(/** ... */)
```

> page.

## Multichain Support

One of the most exciting new features of v2 of the Mirror World SDK is the
multichain support. This means that you can now use the same SDK instance to
interact with multiple chains. This is especially useful if you are building a
dApp that supports multiple chains.

To use the multichain support, you need to initialize the SDK with a
`chainConfig` property. This property accepts an object of chain configurations
from the previous section.

### Invoking chain-specific methods.

In order to invoke a specific method on a chain, you need to use the chain
accessor, and service accessors to invoke the method.

For example, to invoke the `mintNFT` method on the Polygon mainnet chain, you
would do the following:

```ts
import { MirrorWorld, Polygon } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  chainConfig: Polygon("mumbai-mainnet"),
})

await mirrorworld.Polygon.Asset.mintNFT({
  collection_address: "0xB11c14E2F322deC851795224A171Bcf03Dc8573D",
  token_id: 4,
})
```

## All done!

At this point, you should be all set to start using the Mirror World JS SDK v2.
