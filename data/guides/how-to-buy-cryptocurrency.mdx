## Buying cryptocurrency from an Exchange

### 1. Choose a cryptocurrency exchange you want to use

Just like the traditional financial world, there are different types of digital
currencies with different values. Among them, exchanges play the role of
exchanging different digital currencies and exchanging traditional currencies
with digital currencies. Each exchange has slightly different fees and
processes, and you can choose the one you want to follow to complete the buying
process.

### 2. Create and verify your account

Once you have selected a cryptocurrency exchange, you will need to go to the
corresponding exchange platform to register an account. Depending on the
platform and the number of purchases you are making, you will need to verify the
identity of your account, which is an important step in preventing fraud and
meeting federal regulatory requirements (KYC progress). Once your verification
has been cleared, you will be able to buy and sell, etc.

**Note:** In order to successfully pass the verification process and use your
account, please ensure that the information you provide is true and valid
personal information, as you are responsible for all consequences if you provide
false information.

### 3. Adding funds to your exchange account

In order to purchase cryptocurrencies, you need to ensure that you have
sufficient funds in your account. You can deposit funds to your exchange account
by linking your bank account, authorizing a debit card, transferring funds or
paying by credit card. The time and fees for confirming funds vary depending on
the rules of each exchange, so please check the process time and fees in
advance.

### 4. Decide which cryptocurrency you want to buy

Typically, there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies available on the exchanges.
For Smart SDK users, the native currency of the chosen blockchain will be used
as gas fee. For example, if you wish to deploy your NFT or marketplace on
Solana, then your developer account will need to hold a certain amount of
**SOL** to pay the gas fee.

### 5. Place a buy order for your chosen cryptocurrency

According to the rules of the cryptocurrency exchange, you need to make a bid on
the cryptocurrency you want to buy. It is important to note that the price of
cryptocurrencies fluctuates, so be aware of the risk.

### 6. Transfer your cryptocurrency to your smart wallet

Congratulations! You’ve successfully purchased cryptocurrency. Next, the asset
needs to be transferred to your account to support subsequent development. You
can find the address of your account in the top right corner of the dashboard.
