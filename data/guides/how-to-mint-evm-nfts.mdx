In this guide, you will mint NFTs to the collection you created using the Mirror
World SDK. If you do not yet have a collection address, please follow
[this guide to create an ERC721/ERC1155 collection](/guides/how-to-create-evm-nft-collection)
and return to this page to mint NFTs to your collection.

That's it! Let's move forward to minting NFTs.

## Pre-requisites

- [ ] Your `collection_address` is prepared
- [ ] Your have prepared your API credentials (API Key and Secret Access Key).
- [ ] Your wallet has been funded. If you hav

### Funding your project wallet

> Skip this section if your project wallet is already funded

Before minting NFTs to your collection, you need to make sure that your project
wallet is funded with enough funds to pay the gas fee for deployment.

You can see your project wallet on the top-right of the developer dashboard when
you select the Chain/Network combination on the developer dashboard.

- **For Mainnet**, you can fund your wallet by directly transferring funds into
  your project wallet from an external wallet, or exchange.
- **For Testnet,** you can use a faucet to get tokens. Examples of popular
  testnet faucets include [https://mumbaifaucet.com/](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)
  and [https://goerlifaucet.com/](https://goerlifaucet.com/)

### API Credentials

> Skip this section if you already have your API credentials

Minting NFTs requires the following API credentials:

- **API Key** - passed in to the `x-api-key` header. If you don't have an API
  Key, please use the
  [Getting Started](/overview/development-guide/projects#creating-a-project)
  guide to create a project and get the API Key for your project.
- **Secret Access Key** - passed into the
  `Authorization: Bearer <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>` header. If you don't have your
  Secret Access Key yet, please follow
  [this guide to acquire your Secret Access Key](/overview/development-guide/developer-dashboard#secret-access-key-management).

## Minting your ERC721/ERC1155 NFTs

### With HTTP

You can use the
[Mint NFT to collection](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#8f4d519f-a0dd-4710-aab0-cc11579bdca0)
API to mint NFTs to your collection

Replace `:chain` and `:network` parameters to the chain and network combination
you want to deploy to.

> Here is the full
> [table of supported chains](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#multichain-support-matrix).

_Required properties:_

- **`collection_address`**: The address of the collection
- **`token_id`**: The token_id of the NFT to be minted

_Optional properties:_

- **`to_wallet_address`**: The wallet address to which the NFT will be minted.
  You can use this to airdrop NFTs to a user.
- **`mint_amount`**: The amount of NFTs to be minted. Default is 1. For erc721
  collections this value should be 1
- **`confirmation`**: The confirmation level of the transaction. Default is
  finalized. Allowed values are finalized and confirmed

Below is an example code snippet. Take note of the variables to be replaced

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.mirrorworld.fun/v2/:chain/:network/asset/mint/nft' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "collection_address": "<YOUR_COLLECTION_ADDRESS>",
        "token_id": 1
    }'
```

### With JavaScript SDK

This example uses the JavaScript SDK to mint an ERC721 Collection on Ethereum
mainnet.

```tsx
import { MirrorWorld, Ethereum, EVMContractType } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  chainConfig: Ethereum("mainnet"),
  auth: {
    secretAccessKey: "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
  },
})

const payload = {
  collection_address: "0xSOME_COLLECTION_ADDRESS",
  token_id: 1,
}

const nft = await mirrorworld.Ethereum.Asset.mintNFT(payload)
console.log("my new NFT", nft)
```

Congratulations! You have successfully minted an NFT to your EVM-compatible
blockchain collection.
