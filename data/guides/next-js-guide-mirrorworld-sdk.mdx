The Mirror World Smart SDK is a set of cross-platform tools that provides simple,
declarative interfaces for developers with no blockchain development experience
to seamlessly build mobile and web applications into Web3 architecture.

With the Mirror World Smart SDK, you can easily authenticate your users, create secure wallets,
mint NFTs and deploy marketplaces with just a few lines of code.

Mirror World currently has SDK support for Android, iOS (in development), Unity,
Javascript and Rust with support for more frameworks coming soon.

In this tutorial, we’ll be taking a look at how to set up the SDK using
JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Create an Account

To start using the SDK, you’ll need to [create a developer account](https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login).
Your account grants you access to all the features needed to build on Mirror World and it can be
created within seconds. If you run into any issues creating an account, Mirror World has active
communities on [Telegram](https://mirrorworld.fun/telegram) and [Discord](https://mirrorworld.fun/discord)
with people on the Mirror World team ready to help.

### Create a Project

Once you’ve successfully created and verified your account, you’ll be able to
sign in to your developer dashboard. The dashboard contains helpful resources
that’ll assist you in the future when you start building. Go ahead and click the
“Create Project” button to start your first project. Enter a clear project name
in the popup and click “Create”.

### Project Credentials

Every project is created with three major credentials that’ll be used in developing Mirror World using the SDK:

1. API Key: Used to authorize a client to access the Mirror World API.
2. Client ID: Used to publicly identify your project.
3. Client Secret: Sensitive credential that the project owner/developer will use
   to verify certain claims about their project on our Authentication services.

## Building the Application

Let’s go ahead and build a simple application that integrates the Mirror World
API.

Our client is a Next js application that connects with the Mirror World API to
log users in and displays their user details and wallet addresses.

### Project Setup

Create a Next JS app by running this command in your terminal

```shell
yarn create next-app mirrorworld-js
# or
npx create-next-app@latest mirrorworld-js
```

### Install the Mirror World Smart SDK

Next, let’s make sure we have the Mirror World Smart SDK installed in our project.
This will enable us to run the following command in your project’s root directory, in the terminal:

```shell
yarn add @mirrorworld/web3.js
```

### Implementing Login

Let’s implement login functionality into our app using the Mirror World Smart SDK. To
use the SDK, we’ll need to create a new instance of the SDK.

Edit your **index.js** file to look like this

📁 **pages/index.js**

```tsx
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

export default function Home() {
  const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
    apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY", // Replace this with the API Key for your project
    env: ClusterEnvironment.testnet, // Can be ClusterEnvionment.mainnet for mainnet
  })

  return <div className={styles.container}></div>
}
```

Next, we’re going to create a function that logs the user in, and a button to trigger that function.

Update your **index.js** file to look like this

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

const [user, setUser] = useState()

async function login() {
  const { user } = await mirrorworld.login()
  setUser(user)
}

return (
  <div className={styles.container}>
    <main className={styles.main}>
      <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

As you can see, we’ve bound the login method to the button. When you click on
the button a popup appears giving you multiple options to login to mirror world.

We also include a user state using the `useState` hook from React so that we can
set the user object and use it in our app as we’ll see shortly.

Let’s go ahead and display the user information in our app with this piece of
code:

```tsx
return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
        {user ? (
          <div className="user-info">
              <ul>
                <li>Username: {user.username} </li>
                <li>Email: {user.email}</li>
                <li>ETH Address: {user.wallet.eth_address}</li>
                <li>SOL Address: {user.wallet.sol_address}</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p>No User available</p>
        )}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Try to log in again and you should see your user details displayed like this:

## Where to go from here

As you can see, the Mirror World Smart SDK is quite easy to set up and work with. There
are also a lot of other things you can do with the SDK such as swap tokens and
mint NFTs, so don’t just stop at user authentication.

The documentation is a great place to start learning about all the things you
can do with the SDK. The Mirror World team is constantly trying to provide the
best development experience possible, it’ll be great if you joined the Discord
channel and reported issues encountered while developing on their
[GitHub](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe). Can’t wait to see what you
build!
