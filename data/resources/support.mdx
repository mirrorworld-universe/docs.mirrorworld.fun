Various systems are in place to support you through your developer experience.

Three main avenues of support for Mirror World Smart SDK are provided to users:
Discord, Telegram, and Support tickets. We recommend checking the developer
community discord if you run into issues or have questions before submitting a
support ticket.

## Developer Community (Discord or Telegram)

Join our <span onClick = {()=> { window.mixgather.event("join_discord")
window.open("https://forms.gle/RPQti8vLMQer5QnPA")}}>[community
discord]()</span>. or <span onClick = {()=> {
window.mixgather.event("join_discord")
window.open("https://t.me/mirrorworld_sdk")}}>[Telegram]()</span> for
person-to-person support and a space to discuss blockchain-related topics, ask
questions, and engage with other developers. In addition, you can find Mirror
World Smart SDK-specific announcements and seek collaboration on projects. We
hope this can provide a valuable knowledge base and support system for all
blockchain developers, even beyond Mirror World Smart SDK users.
