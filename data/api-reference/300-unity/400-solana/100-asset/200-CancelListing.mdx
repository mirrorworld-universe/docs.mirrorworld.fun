# `CancelListing`

Cancel listing NFT on Marketplace.
### Parameters
`mintAddress|string` - Mint address of a NFT.

`price|double` - Price of this NFT on marketplace.

`auction_house|string` - Which marketplace the target NFT on.

`confirmation|string` - Confirmation of this request, you can check what confirmation we have by checking Confirmation class. If you want to get more information, please refer to [explain of confirmation](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/api-reference/unity/configuration#confirmation).

`approveFinish|Action` - This action will be invoked after the user completes the permission verification in the approval process. You can use it to provide UI prompts. For example, in a game, after calling the current API, you can immediately display a "Waiting" UI. The SDK will then automatically pop up the permission verification interface. When the user enters the password on the interface and clicks "Return," this action will be called to close the previous "Waiting" UI.

`action|Action<CommonResponse<ListingResponse>>` - The callback function of this method is used to receive the results.

### Returns
`response class` - `CommonResponse<SolResBuyNFT>`

### Code Example
```csharp
string mintAddress = "mint_address";
double price = 1;
string auctionHouse = "your_market_auction_house";
string confirmation = Confirmation.Default;
Action approveFinish = null;

MWSDK.Solana.Asset.CancelListing(mintAddress, price, auctionHouse, confirmation, approveFinish, (res) =>
{
    CommonResponse<ListingResponse> resObj = res;

    //todo...
