# Introduction

Mirror World Smart Platform was built to simplify the process of building Web3 web and mobile applications for high-conversion or even for hobbyists that want to build simple applications. Building simple Web3 apps should be simple.

Mirror World's offering makes it possible to build powerful multi-chain Web3 experiences for mobile and the web by providing top-class and easy-to-use APIs and cross-platform SDKs around 3 main features:

1. [Smart Authentication](/solutions/smart-auth) - User-friendly Authentication
2. [Smart Marketplace](/solutions/smart-marketplace) - Asset Management (NFTs and Marketplaces)
3. [Smart Wallet](/solutions/smart-wallet) - Wallets Service


## Quick Start (5 minutes)

The fastest way to get started with Mirror World's API is to get an API key on the developer dashboard, and consume it in the SDK of the platform you’re building for.
