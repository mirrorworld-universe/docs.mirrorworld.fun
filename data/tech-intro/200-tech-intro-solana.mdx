> **ðŸ‘‰ **Note**<br />
Smart Platform provides a comprehensive one-stop solution that allows you to access the full functionality of SDK. At the same time, our features are also supported for standalone use, so you can choose the features that meet your needs.**

## Technical Structure

### Authentication

Smart Authentication enables free, seamless, one-click authentication. Itâ€™s especially helpful to onboard users without prior knowledge about wallet.

Authentication methods include:

- Social Authentication
    - Google
    - Apple
    - Twitter
    - Discord
- Email & Password

![email-password](/docs/images/techintro/email-password.png)

#### Authentication Flow

![authentication-flow.png](/docs/images/techintro/authentication-flow.png)

A client can authenticate through social authentications (e.g. google). Once the client gets the JWT token, it can be included in the following requests to access/update/delete the resources that user owns (e.g. transfer ethers from clientâ€™s in-app-wallet to somewhere else).

- [Next.js Guide for MirrorWorld SDK](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/guides/next-js-guide-mirrorworld-sdk)

### Wallets

Specification:

- Query userâ€™s tokens
- Query userâ€™s transaction history
- Transfer Tokens
- Swap Tokens
- Crypto On-ramp
- Deposit Tokens
- Spend Tokens
- Earn Tokens
- Withdraw Tokens

The following wallet UI is built entirely based on our wallet backend.

<video src="/docs/images/techintro/wallet-demo2-1.mp4" autoPlay={true} muted={true} preload="auto" loop={true} />

#### Key Generation

Once a new user is authenticated through our SDK, we automatically create a wallet for that user. The private key is encrypted and securely stored in our cloud infrastructure.

![key-generation](/docs/images/techintro/key-generation.png)

#### How to Keep Your Key Secure

- The user's private key never leaves our cloud infrastructure.

The key generation, encryption, decryption, and storage are all happening in the cloud. The overall process is never exposed to the external.

- The user's key is encrypted by the third-part KMS(Key Management System).

We don't store the plain-text private key. Instead, only the encrypted key is stored in our backend. The encryption is done by a trustable third-party KMS provider with strict access control policies to protect the data encryption data. Moreover, the encryption key never leaves the KMS.

### On-Ramp

We provide crypto on-ramp service on Solana. The service provide a way to allow user purchase crypto token using their credit card.

Our on-ramp service is designed to be a stand-alone service. It means that the developer can use it without using our wallet or marketplace product. The only thing the developer needs to do is put the projectâ€™s api-key in the request header.

#### Crypto On-ramp

For now, we are using Moonpay as our on-ramp provider. It handles the KYC and payment for us.

### Marketplace

Specification:

- Asset minting
    - Create NFT Collection
    - Mint NFTs into collection
- Marketplace
    - Create Seaport Marketplace instance
    - List NFTs
    - Buy NFTs
    - Cancel listing
    - Update Listing
- Query NFTs
    - By Owner
    - By Creators
    - By Update Authorities
- Query NFT Transaction History

#### Create your Marketplace Instance

Behind the scenes, Mirror World uses the widely supportedÂ MetaplexÂ to orchestrate asset minting.

Metaplex provides a tool for safely and efficiently asset minting. Thanks to Solanaâ€™s account based design, the developer doesnâ€™t need deploy a new contract to mint NFT. Instead, developer can leverage our contract template, and directly interact with MirrorWorldâ€™s Solana asset minting contract by calling our API/SDK.

## Developer Onboarding

### Developer Guide

1. **Interacting with the Mirror World Smart Platform**

    There are two ways to interact with the Mirror World API cluster:

    - **Official Client SDKs**Â - Beginner-friendly, recommended, cross-platform.
        - [JavaScript](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/integration/js)
        - [Android](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/integration/android)
        - [Unity](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/integration/unity)
        - [iOS](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/integration/ios)
        - [Rust](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/integration/rust)
    - **HTTP API**Â - Advanced, For complex operations.
        - If you're more comfortable with using HTTP API via theÂ `[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)`Â  API or with an HTTP API client likeÂ [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), you can also use the Mirror World Smart Platform's HTTP API Interface. This is most suitable for performing scripting tasks like batch minting NFTs, or if you are consuming the API on the back end.

        **Check HTTP APIs here:** [https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/)

#### SDK Integration Guide

<aside>
ðŸš§ Mirror World is now supporting Smart Platform **SDK V1.0** and Smart Platform **SDK V2.0**. If youâ€™re new user, we recommend you to use SDK V2.0. If you are using our SDK V1.0, don't worry, we will keep providing support for SDK V1.0.

- [Rust](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/integration/rust)  
Will be upgraded to V2 soon.

#### Developer Authentication

Developers can authenticate themselves on the Mirror World API by using their developer **Secret Access Key.** This is a sensitive credential that can bypass action approval for assets in the developers' wallet. This is useful for debugging and performing batch requests with your wallet address or interacting with the API on a back end service.You can get the Secret Access Key on the **Account Settings menu** on the developer dashboard.

The usage for the Secret Access Key is similar to that for the user's auth token as shown below. This request queries the developer's user information. The return type can be found in **[Http API Reference.](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#3df5eef0-b278-419a-a8ef-c7286c2e6419)**

<aside>
ðŸ‘‰ Whereas this is useful for debugging and testing, it is advised not to paste this credential in a location that is compromised.

#### Troubleshooting Errors

All errors returned from the Mirror World API cluster are documented here on theÂ [API Error Reference Page](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/further-reading/api-error-reference).
