Smart Platform provides a comprehensive one-stop solution that allows you to access the full functionality of SDK. At the same time, our features are also supported for standalone use, so you can choose the features that meet your needs.**

## Technical Structure

### Authentication

Smart Authentication enables free, seamless, one-click authentication. Itâ€™s especially helpful to onboard users without prior knowledge about wallet.

Authentication methods include:

- Social Authentication
    - Google
    - Apple
    - Twitter
    - Discord
- Email & Password

![email-password](/docs/images/techintro/email-password.png)

#### Authentication Flow

![authentication-flow.png](/docs/images/techintro/authentication-flow.png)

A client can authenticate through social authentications (e.g. google). Once the client gets the JWT token, it can be included in the following requests to access/update/delete the resources that user owns (e.g. transfer ethers from clientâ€™s in-app-wallet to somewhere else).

- [Next.js Guide for MirrorWorld SDK](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/guides/next-js-guide-mirrorworld-sdk)

### Wallets

Specification:

- Query userâ€™s tokens
- Query userâ€™s transaction history
- Transfer Tokens
- Swap Tokens
- Crypto On-ramp
- Deposit Tokens
- Spend Tokens
- Earn Tokens
- Withdraw Tokens

The following wallet UI is built entirely based on our wallet backend.

<video src="/docs/images/techintro/wallet-demo2-1.mp4" autoPlay={true} muted={true} preload="auto" loop={true} />

#### Key Generation

Once a new user is authenticated through our SDK, we automatically create a wallet for that user. The private key is encrypted and securely stored in our cloud infrastructure.

![key-generation](/docs/images/techintro/key-generation.png)

#### How to Keep Your Key Secure

- The user's private key never leaves our cloud infrastructure.

The key generation, encryption, decryption, and storage are all happening in the cloud. The overall process is never exposed to the external.

- The user's key is encrypted by the third-part KMS(Key Management System).

We don't store the plain-text private key. Instead, only the encrypted key is stored in our backend. The encryption is done by a trustable third-party KMS provider with strict access control policies to protect the data encryption data. Moreover, the encryption key never leaves the KMS.

### On-Ramp

We provide two types of on-ramp services: crypto on-ramp and NFT checkout. Both products provide a way to allow user purchase crypto or NFT using their credit card.

Both on-ramp services are designed to be a stand-alone services. It means that the developer can use them without using our wallet or marketplace product. The only thing the developer needs to do is put the projectâ€™s api-key in the request header.

#### Crypto On-ramp

For now, we are using Moonpay as our on-ramp provider. It handles the KYC and payment for us.

#### NFT Checkout

![NFTcheckout](/docs/images/techintro/NFTcheckout.png)

Notes:

- The client needs provide their ERC721/1155 contract. Before the contract is deployed, airdrop() should grant us with enough permission to mint nft to desired address.

### Marketplace

Specification:

- Asset minting
    - Create ERC721/1155 Collection
    - Mint NFTs into collection
- Marketplace
    - Create Seaport Marketplace instance
    - List NFTs
    - Buy NFTs
    - Cancel listing
    - Update Listing
- Query NFTs
    - By Owner
    - By Creators
    - By Update Authorities
- Query NFT Transaction History

#### Deploying your Marketplace Instance

Behind the scenes, Mirror World uses the widely supportedÂ [Seaport Protocol](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport)Â to orchestrate marketplace listings and transactions.

Seaport is a marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs. Each listing contains an arbitrary number of items that the offerer is willing to give (the "offer") along with an arbitrary number of items that must be received along with their respective receivers (the "consideration").

## Developer Onboarding

### Developer Guide

<aside>
ðŸ‘‰ Our team will help you setup your project and testing environment on our dashboard. You can easily found the all keys on dashboard to manage your project.

#### Developer Dashboard
[Preview Link](https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login)

1. **Interacting with the Mirror World Smart Platform**

    There are two ways to interact with the Mirror World API cluster:

    - **Official Client SDKs**Â - Beginner-friendly, recommended, cross-platform.
        - [JavaScript](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/api-reference/js/Configuration)
        - Android
        - Unity, iOS and Rust for Polygon coming soon
    - **HTTP API**Â - Advanced, For complex operations.
        - If you're more comfortable with using HTTP API via theÂ `[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)`Â  API or with an HTTP API client likeÂ [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), you can also use the Mirror World Smart Platform's HTTP API Interface. This is most suitable for performing scripting tasks like batch minting NFTs, or if you are consuming the API on the back end.

        **Check HTTP APIs here:** [https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/)

#### SDK Integration Guides

Currently, Mirror World launches on Java

1. JavaScript
**Check this integration doc:** [https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/api-reference/js/Configuration](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/api-reference/js/Configuration)
2. Android
Document will be updated on 04/2023

#### Developer Authentication

Developers can authenticate themselves on the Mirror World API by using their developer **Secret Access Key.** This is a sensitive credential that can bypass action approval for assets in the developers' wallet. This is useful for debugging and performing batch requests with your wallet address or interacting with the API on a back end service.You can get the Secret Access Key on the **Account Settings menu** on the developer dashboard.

The usage for the Secret Access Key is similar to that for the user's auth token as shown below. This request queries the developer's user information. The return type can be found in **[Http API Reference.](https://developer.mirrorworld.fun/#3df5eef0-b278-419a-a8ef-c7286c2e6419)**

<aside>
ðŸ‘‰ Whereas this is useful for debugging and testing, it is advised not to paste this credential in a location that is compromised.

#### Troubleshooting Errors

All errors returned from the Mirror World API cluster are documented here on theÂ [API Error Reference Page](https://mirrorworld.fun/docs/further-reading/api-error-reference).
