In [Mirrors Jump](/showcase/games/mirrors-jump), we use Smart Wallet, which
helps users to make cryptocurrency purchases, trade cryptocurrency, and earn
rewards directly in the game.

Your players, without having to understand a lot of complicated terms, without
having to store private key, and without having to worry about the security of
their assets, will be able to purchase cryptocurrency with their credit card and
then use and trade it in the game.
